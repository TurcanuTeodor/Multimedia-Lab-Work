# Music Library (Bootstrap)

A responsive album grid built with Bootstrap 5. Cards show artwork, artist, album, and a button to open a modal with details.

## Structure

- **Grid** — Responsive columns via Bootstrap's grid system
- **Cards** — Image, artist, album, action button
- **Modal** — Displays selected album's tracklist and info

## Exercises

1. Load albums from `library.json` and render cards dynamically
2. Open modal per album; set title to "Artist — Album" and list tracks
3. Link track titles to Spotify (`url`) in a new tab
4. Add search/filter and simple sorting (artist, album, track count)
5. Improve styling: equal card heights, hover effects, smooth transitions
6. Show track stats (count, total duration, longest/shortest)
7. Ensure mobile-friendly layout and readable modal
